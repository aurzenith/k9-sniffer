# K9 Sniffer
K9 Sniffer is a project to inspect an entire TCP/IPv4 packet (including frame) and understand each part of it byte by byte.

---
## Goals
It will start with just one sample packet & frame captured from Wireshark.

Then later will be able understand, and display a stream of packets and their information.

Essentially the main code will act as a library to understand what is coming in.
